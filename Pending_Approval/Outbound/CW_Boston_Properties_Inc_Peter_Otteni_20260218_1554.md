Hi Peter,

I came across 725 12th Street Northwest Office Building and wanted to briefly introduce Building Code Consulting LLC (BCC) as a resource for Boston Properties, Inc.'s Third-Party Inspection and Plan Review needs.

BCC is a DC-based firm specializing in Third-Party Code Compliance Inspections and Plan Review. A few highlights:

Multi-Discipline Expertise: Our team holds PE licenses (Civil and Electrical) and ICC Master Code Professional (MCP) certifications. We handle Building, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and Fire inspections under one roof and resolve technical code questions on-site to prevent delays.

Responsive Scheduling: We offer same-day or next-business-day inspection availability to keep your project milestones on track.

Fair, Visit-Based Billing: Billing is based on actual visits completed — our fee is a flat rate per inspection visit actually performed. You will never be billed based on an upfront estimate. If your project wraps up in fewer inspections than projected, you pay only for what was done.

Also, as a quick note — BCC also offers Third-Party Plan Review Services for DC and nationwide jurisdictions. If your team needs expedited pre-submission code review or peer review, we would be glad to assist.

We are not submitting a formal proposal at this stage, but if you would like to learn more about our services for 725 12th Street Northwest Office Building, we would welcome the conversation.

Are you open to a quick 5-minute call?
