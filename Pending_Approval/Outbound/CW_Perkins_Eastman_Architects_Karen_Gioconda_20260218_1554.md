Hi Karen,

I came across Ward 8 Senior Wellness Center and wanted to briefly introduce Building Code Consulting LLC (BCC). We often collaborate with architects on Third-Party Code Compliance reviews and inspections for DC projects.

BCC is a DC-based firm specializing in DC Third-Party Code Compliance and Plan Review. A few highlights relevant to Perkins Eastman Architects:

Multi-Discipline Expertise: Our team holds PE licenses (Civil and Electrical) and ICC Master Code Professional (MCP) certifications. We handle Building, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and Fire inspections under one roof and resolve technical code questions on-site to prevent delays.

Responsive Scheduling: We offer same-day or next-business-day inspection availability to keep your project milestones on track.

Fair, Visit-Based Billing: Billing is based on actual visits completed — our fee is a flat rate per inspection visit actually performed. You will never be billed based on an upfront estimate. If your project wraps up in fewer inspections than projected, you pay only for what was done.

We also offer Third-Party Plan Review and peer review services that can help identify code issues before submission — reducing revision cycles and protecting your project schedule.

We are not submitting a formal proposal at this stage, but would welcome the opportunity to discuss how BCC can support Ward 8 Senior Wellness Center.

Are you open to a quick 5-minute call?
