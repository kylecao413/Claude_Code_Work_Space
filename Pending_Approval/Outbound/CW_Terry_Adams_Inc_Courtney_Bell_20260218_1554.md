Hi Courtney,

I noticed Terry Adams, Inc. is working on Rivian Build-Out in Washington, DC and wanted to take a moment to introduce Building Code Consulting LLC (BCC) as a potential resource for your Third-Party Inspection needs.

BCC is a DC-based engineering firm focused exclusively on Washington, D.C. Third-Party Code Compliance Inspections. A few reasons Terry Adams, Inc. may find us a strong fit for this project:

Multi-Discipline Expertise: Our team holds PE licenses (Civil and Electrical) and ICC Master Code Professional (MCP) certifications. We handle Building, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and Fire inspections under one roof and resolve technical code questions on-site to prevent delays.

Responsive Scheduling: We offer same-day or next-business-day inspection availability to keep your project milestones on track.

Fair, Visit-Based Billing: Billing is based on actual visits completed — our fee is a flat rate per inspection visit actually performed. You will never be billed based on an upfront estimate. If your project wraps up in fewer inspections than projected, you pay only for what was done.

We are not submitting a formal proposal at this stage, but if you are still finalizing your inspection vendor list for this project, we would welcome the opportunity to provide a competitive quote.

Are you open to a quick 5-minute call or a brief capability overview?
